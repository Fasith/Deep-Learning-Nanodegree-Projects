<h2>Dog Breed Classifier</h2>

<h4>Project Overview</h4>

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, 
you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. 
If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, 
you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app. 
By completing this lab, you demonstrate your understanding of the challenges involved
in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.
