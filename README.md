# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects
This repository contains source code for the projects that i did as a part of the deep learning nanodegree programme in udacity.

This Repo contains the following projects:-
  1)Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns using a NN built from scratch
  2)Dog-Breed classifier using Transfer-Learning (Pytorch)
  3)TV Script generation using LSTM network(Pytorch)
  4)Face generator using GANs (generates realistic faces)(Pytorch)
  5)Deploying a Sentiment Analysis model in Amazon SageMaker
  
  
  
Requirements:-
1)Pytorch
2)Python 3.6
3)Numpy
5)Matplotlib
6)Pandas
