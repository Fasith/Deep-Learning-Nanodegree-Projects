# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects
This repository contains source code for the projects that i did as a part of the deep learning nanodegree programme in udacity.
<br>


#### This Repo contains the following projects:-

  1)Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns using a NN built from scratch<br>
  2)Dog-Breed classifier using Transfer-Learning (Pytorch)<br>
  3)TV Script generation using LSTM network(Pytorch)<br>
  4)Face generator using GANs (generates realistic faces)(Pytorch)<br>
  5)Deploying a Sentiment Analysis model in Amazon SageMaker<br>
  
  
  
#### Requirements:-
1)Pytorch<br>
2)Python 3.6<br>
3)Numpy<br>
